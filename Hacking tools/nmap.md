# Enumeration with nmap
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.<br>

### 3 way TCP handshake
During the communication with a TCP service, a single connection is established with the TCP 3 way handshake:
1. The client sends a **SYN** to a TCP open port 
2. If the server sees the **SYN**, it will reply with a **SYN ACK**
3. If the client sees the **SYN ACK**, it replies with an ACK

In this way, data can be exchanged between the parties. The possible types of port, that *nmap* can detect, are:
<details><summary>Filtered port</summary>
A filtered port result from Nmap indicates that the port has not responded at all. The SYN packet has simply been dropped by the firewall.

</details>
<details><summary>Closed port</summary>
Closed ports most commonly indicate there is no service running on the port, but the firewall has allowed the connection to go through to the server. It can also mean that no firewall is present at all.<br>
It is possible to configure a firewall to reject packets rather than drop. This would mean that packets hitting the firewall would be seen as closed (the firewall is responding with RST ACK).

</details>
<details><summary>Open port</summary>
Open Ports are usually what you are looking for when kicking off *nmap* scans. The open service could be a publicly accessible service that is, by its nature, supposed to be accessible. It may be a backend service that does not need to be publicly accessible, and therefore should be blocked by a firewall.
